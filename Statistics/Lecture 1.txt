Lecture 1

 
￼
It is the branch of science which involves collecting, analysing, data in large quantities so that we can come up with various use cases, exploring and visualising and coming out with meaning information and conclusions 


Topics which we will see:

Descriptive statistics
Inferential statistics
Population
Sample
Sampling techniques
Measure of central tendency
Measure of dispersion or Variance 
Probability
Permutation and combination


￼
Different sampling methods

	1.	Random sampling-  randomly getting selected 
Disadvantage :- 
a) overlapping- some cases are being repeated
b) For specific use case - 

	2.	Stratified sampling-population is divided into Stratus( male and female) 
Male for exit pole
Household for females

So we are dividing them into subgroups. 


	3.	Systematic sampling-  doing sampling systematically, that is if we take the second person then 4th then 6th then 8th. We are following a system
It might lead to bias which means more than 1 type in a sample




	4.	Clustering sample-  Clusters of groups

Every group will give different answers
We will take groups instead of individuals 

Targeting different clusters of customers( based on expenses we will target different sets of rich and poor customers)

 Random variable - whose value depends on the outcome of a random phenomena
